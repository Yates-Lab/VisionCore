# VisionCore Training System Review - Documentation Index

This directory contains a comprehensive review of the VisionCore training system, focusing on `train_ddp_multidataset.py` and identifying redundancies, dead code paths, and refactoring opportunities.

## 📚 Documentation Files

### 1. **TRAINING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md** ⭐ START HERE
**Executive summary of findings and recommendations**

- TL;DR of current state
- Key findings (what's working, what's not)
- Architecture comparison (current vs proposed)
- Redundancy analysis with specific files to remove
- Dead code paths
- Feature comparison (old vs new Lightning modules)
- Recommendations by priority
- Migration strategies (Conservative, Aggressive, Hybrid)
- Next steps and discussion questions

**Read this first** to understand the overall situation.

---

### 2. **CODEBASE_REVIEW_TRAINING.md**
**Detailed technical review of the training infrastructure**

- Current training architecture breakdown
- Component-by-component analysis
- Data flow diagrams
- Redundancies and dead code (detailed)
- Proposed refactoring strategy (short/medium/long-term)
- Specific recommendations
- Testing gaps
- File inventory

**Read this** for deep technical details.

---

### 3. **REFACTORING_ACTION_PLAN.md**
**Step-by-step implementation guide**

- Phase 1: Immediate Cleanup (2-4 hours, low risk)
  - Remove duplicate training script
  - Remove duplicate shell scripts
  - Update paths
  - Clean commented code
  
- Phase 2: Deprecate Old Lightning Modules (1-2 days, moderate risk)
  - Move to `models/lightning_deprecated/`
  - Update imports with deprecation warnings
  - Update checkpoint loading
  
- Phase 3: Extract Components (1-2 days, higher risk)
  - Extract `MultiDatasetModel` to `training/lightning/`
  - Extract `MultiDatasetDM` to `training/lightning/`
  - Extract samplers, callbacks, schedulers

**Use this** as your implementation guide.

---

### 4. **cleanup_duplicates.sh** 🚀 READY TO RUN
**Automated cleanup script for Phase 1**

```bash
# Dry run (see what would happen)
bash cleanup_duplicates.sh --dry-run

# Actually run the cleanup
bash cleanup_duplicates.sh
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Removes duplicate `train_ddp_multidataset.py`
- ✅ Removes duplicate shell scripts
- ✅ Updates shell scripts to use canonical paths
- ✅ Creates backups before modifying files
- ✅ Checks for file differences before removing
- ✅ Dry-run mode for safety

**Run this** to execute Phase 1 cleanup.

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### If you want to understand the situation (5 minutes):
1. Read **TRAINING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md** sections:
   - TL;DR
   - Key Findings
   - Recommendations by Priority

### If you want to clean up duplicates NOW (30 minutes):
1. Read **TRAINING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md** → "High Priority" section
2. Run `bash cleanup_duplicates.sh --dry-run`
3. Review output
4. Run `bash cleanup_duplicates.sh`
5. Test: `bash experiments/run_all_models.sh` (with small test config)

### If you want to plan a full refactoring (1 hour):
1. Read **TRAINING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md** → "Migration Strategy"
2. Read **REFACTORING_ACTION_PLAN.md** → All phases
3. Decide on Conservative/Aggressive/Hybrid approach
4. Schedule time for implementation

### If you want deep technical details (2 hours):
1. Read **CODEBASE_REVIEW_TRAINING.md** → All sections
2. Review the mermaid diagrams (rendered in the documents)
3. Explore the code sections referenced

---

## 📊 Visual Diagrams

The review includes several Mermaid diagrams:

1. **Training Architecture Diagram** (in CODEBASE_REVIEW_TRAINING.md)
   - Shows entry points, active system, deprecated system, duplicates
   - Color-coded: green (active), red (remove/deprecated)

2. **Old vs New Comparison** (in CODEBASE_REVIEW_TRAINING.md)
   - Side-by-side comparison of Lightning modules
   - Shows feature differences

3. **Proposed Refactoring** (in CODEBASE_REVIEW_TRAINING.md)
   - Before/after structure
   - Shows modular organization

---

## 🎨 Key Findings at a Glance

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Fix Now)
- Duplicate `train_ddp_multidataset.py` in `jake/multidataset_ddp/`
- Duplicate shell scripts in `jake/multidataset_ddp/`
- **Action:** Run `cleanup_duplicates.sh`

### 🟡 Deprecated Code (Fix Soon)
- `models/lightning/core.py` - NOT used by active training
- `models/lightning/multidataset.py` - NOT used by active training
- **Action:** Move to `models/lightning_deprecated/`

### 🟢 Improvement Opportunities (Nice to Have)
- Extract components to separate modules
- Add unit tests
- Add documentation
- **Action:** Follow Phase 3 of refactoring plan

---

## 📈 Recommended Path Forward

### Week 1: Quick Wins (Low Risk)
```bash
# Day 1: Remove duplicates
bash cleanup_duplicates.sh
git commit -m "Remove duplicate training scripts"

# Day 2: Deprecate old modules
# Follow Phase 2 of REFACTORING_ACTION_PLAN.md

# Day 3: Test everything
bash experiments/run_all_models.sh
```

### Week 2: Documentation (No Risk)
- Add docstrings to `train_ddp_multidataset.py`
- Create training guide
- Document curriculum learning

### Future: Refactoring (If Needed)
- Extract components (Phase 3)
- Add tests
- Consider Hydra for config management

## 🤔 Decision Points

Before starting, answer these questions:

1. **Do we have old checkpoints that need to load?**
   - ✅ Yes → Need careful backward compatibility (Phase 2)
   - ❌ No → Can be more aggressive

2. **Is `jake/multidataset_ddp/` still needed?**
   - ✅ Yes → Review before deleting
   - ❌ No → Safe to clean up

3. **What's the timeline?**
   - 🏃 Urgent → Do Phase 1 only
   - 📅 This month → Do Phase 1-2
   - 🗓️ This quarter → Do Phase 1-3

4. **Who will maintain this?**
   - 👤 Just you → Keep it simple (Phase 1-2)
   - 👥 Team → Worth investing in Phase 3

- [ ] Checkpoints save correctly
- [ ] WandB logging works
- [ ] Multi-GPU DDP works
- [ ] Curriculum learning works (if enabled)
- [ ] Old checkpoints still load (if applicable)
