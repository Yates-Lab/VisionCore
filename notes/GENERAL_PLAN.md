## General plan for this repo
this repos supports the fitting of a single computational core to many neurophsyiological datasets collected from visual cortex.

we want to turn it into the complete path for analyzing neuropyshiological data for a paper.

the paper will have the following structure:

For decades, scientists have called for the study of neural processing during natural behavior, but it's been prohibitively hard. To date, studies of neural responses during natural vision have tended to either flash images or movies during controlled fixation or have reduced resolution / impoverished stimuli in lower resolution organisms (eg., mice). We developed tools to make this possible and now study V1 during free viewing of natural scenes at a resolution of 1 arcminute.

To evaluate how the 




Here's what we want to show to 

1) training with multiple datasets informing one core is better than training with one dataset at a time.
2) the core can be used to make predictions about new datasets.
3) the core captures selectivity of neurons
